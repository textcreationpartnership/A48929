            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Scripture is full of theſe Secrets, as to the notion of truth: but, O how full of ſecrets is truth in its operation in our hearts! In this latter I am moſt a Student, and yet leaſt a Proficient; though I have but little skill in the notion, yet farre leſſe in the myſterious operation of the Goſpell. What experiences Chriſt hath imparted, in much love, I here preſent unto you: they may be much added unto, by heavenly influences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb facs="tcp:54212:3"/>and peculiar to every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader, and by his owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in theſe waies of wiſdome. We are called <hi>little ones:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo we are whilſt here, little in all things but ignorance and impotence. Yet we little ones have great ones waiting upon us, and theſe have more priviledge then we whom they wait upon, which is another ſecret, for <hi>they alwaies behold the face of our father:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 18 10.</note> which if we could doe too, we ſhould in his light ſee light, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all myſteries and all knowledge, all truth in notion and operation: which ſhould make us wait for the appearing of Chriſt, and long till this change come, that Lords have as much as their ſervants which attend upon them. Blood carries the life and the exquiſite ſpirit and ſence of
<pb facs="tcp:54212:4"/>nature with it, and yet hath not ſence nor feeling it ſelfe: ſo truly is it with us Miniſters, we are the Salt of the earth, the blood and ſpirit of the World, ſuch as carry exquiſite ſpirit and ſenſe through the myſticall body, and yet feele juſt nothing (upon the matter) our ſelves. which makes us ſo ſhort of what we ſhould be, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the myſteries of the Goſpell; I ſpeak in this, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of one, who hath his births in divine things, to much out of due time and due meaſure, yet hath to bleſſe God, that I can condemne my ſelfe. The more Heavenly in our lives, the more the beſt knowledge falls in of it ſelfe with us. Living creatures which lie hid in the earth long, for a great part of the yeere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, have (we ſay) no blood,
<pb facs="tcp:54212:4"/>or very little, a drop or two about the heart. If our ſouls lie hid in the earth much (as theſe times tempt this way) you will have little good blood or ſpirit in you; a drop about your heart to keepe you from Hell hereafter, and that will be all; not enough to keepe you from many Hels here: much leſſe will you have ſo much blood and brave ſpirit, as to ſearch and finde the deep things of God belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your peace, crowne, and glory.

Flocks of holineſſes are not onely numerous, but glorious. Flocks of Flowers in the ſpring, flocks of Pearles like Pibles upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, all facing the Sun; yea or flocks
<pb facs="tcp:54212:7"/>of Suns looking forth like the morning, from ſeverall ſerene parts and points of our Horiſon, and all facing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not ſo glorious as flocks of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes facing Chriſt, and Chriſt them.

Obey neceſſity, read two Volumes over and over all the daies of thy life, the written word and thine unwritten heart; the one riddle unriddles the other: the Volume without opens the Volume within, and is a Glaſſe to bring Chriſt and the ſoule face to face. The triall of our faith is
<pb facs="tcp:54212:9"/>precious, whether by the rod or by the word: by both grace is refined much, which is very precious to a ſincere heart. Comparing our ſelves oft with Chriſt ſhames us, humbles us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us, and ſo derives his beauty whom we ſo intenſely look upon, which is a pleaſant tranſlation from defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity unto beauty and glory. <note place="margin">

So truly may I ſay, by our weakneſſes, ſloath, careleſneſſe, the divel more prevailes, then by his own ſtrength ſimply conſidered, though a creature very ſtrong. We ſo cut off our own locks, and caſt off our own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, our own armour, and walke naked, laying aſide Ordinances, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all cloſe converſation with God and our ſelves, that ſatan ſlayes us heaps upon heaps, with the jaw-bone of an Aſſe, with any rotten fooliſh

Take heed Chriſtians of hypocriſie, its property is pride: pride puffes up, and then God puls all down to worſe then nothing: a little of this leaven leavens the whole lumpe: be purging out therefore daily, every little of this leaven, that when ſatan and temptations come, they may finde nothing (if poſſible) of hypocriſie in you. Lie at thoſe breaſts which give ſincere milk. Let your ſoules conceive by pure ſtreams. Perſons who venture in preaching, doe not you venture in hearing. Tis a ventrous age, ſuch as no eye ever ſaw more, and leſſe laid to heart. Among all wonders amidst us, this is ſurely the greateſt, that there is
<pb facs="tcp:54212:10"/>not yet ſhipwrack of all, conſidering how venterous all are, and of and to what parts. In that miniſtery in which you cannot ſee your ſelves, ſurely you cannot ſee Chriſt, how much and how oft ſo ever he may be named, as tis true <hi>è contrà.</hi> Grievous wolves are entred in among us, tearing and rending all that is hopefull; the ſenſe of this makes me to complaine, not any bodies doing well.

If we yet doe wickedly, and deale hypocritically with our God, who hath brought us out with a ſtrong hand, from the Iron yoake, and the burning brickill, ſurely ſeven times more will miſery multiply upon us untill we die, becauſe we have deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him which ſpeaks from Heaven, and as much from Heaven, and from that excellent glory (I thinke) as to any of the Gentile world. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſpirit God hath mingled amongſt us, that we can neither ſmite nor ſmile with God, we can neither mourne nor daunce to him, which doth thus to

Lets all lean upon our beloved: but what's more and inconſiſtent with this, proceedeth from the guile of our ſpirits, and that wily one, and will be a Spiders Web, and make the ſhame of our nakedneſſe to appeare in the day of his appearing, who is the ſearcher of all hearts: which apparition he loves and waits for, who is till then</p>

If God meant me good, why did he let me runne ſo long, play the prodigall ſo long till I had ſpent all? and this a type of the Gentiles, and of this truth I am upon. 'Twas doubtfull to the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall how things would prove, when viſitations from above began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to his ſpirit.

A Nation that enjoyes the Goſpell at preſent, hath a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſomething then they which may enjoy it an hundred yeeres hence, if we ſpeak of certainty as we count, and put the nature of it: for concerning what is behind, and yet to come, we ſtill are apt to queſtion, will it be? will it ever come? every one at firſt ſets forth good Wine; but that good Wine ſhould come at laſt, is not according to the law of cuſtome and order ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily expected.</p>

In which place we ſee what all the viſible ordinances of God are principally to hold out as their and our vigour and life, to wit, Chriſt riſen from the dead. The like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is that Act. 4.33. <hi>And with great
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54212:19"/>power gave the Apoſtles witneſſe of the Lord Ieſus</hi> (and obſerve the effect of this miniſtery thus pointed) <hi>and great grace was upon them all,</hi> Act. 2.36, 37. and by both you ſhall ſee in what eſpecially is wrapt up the converting vigor of viſible ordinances. <hi>Therefore let all the houſe of Iſrael knew aſſuredly, that God hath made the ſame Ieſus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Chriſt,</hi> (i.) <hi>raiſed him up, and ſet him at his right hand.

Chriſt to take off the admiration of his Diſciples at his reviving, and comming againe after death amongſt them, and ſitting and eating with them, ſaith, <hi>Theſe are the words which I ſpake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things muſt be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moſes, and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalms concerning me.</hi>

Chriſts reſurrection is a ſeale of the reſurrection of all, good and bad:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54212:20"/>Nay, Chriſt being riſen, all ſhall riſe and come to judgement; to this height the Apoſtle carries this point. <hi>Becauſe he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by the man whom he hath appointed, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead,</hi> Act. 17.31. I collect from the Scripture that Chriſts reſurrection ſealeth two things to us, that all ſhall riſe, and that all ſhall come to be judged by him. And O wicked man, how dreadfull will this judgement be to thee? 'Tis dreadfull for a Chriſtian to be brought now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt in the Court of conſcience, as he ſits there, and makes that weake part of man to ſpeak againſt one in his ſtead, as I gather by that of <hi>Ioh; And doſt thou open thine eye upon ſuch a one, and bringeſt me into judgement?</hi> Job 14.3. and calls man a ſhadow. Man here, is indeed but a ſhadow, gone of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as flower; and yet to bring this ſhadow into judgement before Chriſt, as he ſits in the Court of conſcience here, O how unſuſſerably dreadfull it is to a good man! but how dreadfull then to a bad! but how dreadfull will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54212:21"/>it to be a wicked man hereafter, when brought before Chriſt perſonally, and in all his glory as Judge of all the world, with ten thouſand of his Saints, as <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeakes, when neither Judge nor Judged a ſhadow; when every wicked man ſhall be brought in a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition and ſtate of body, as well as of ſoule, to beare a blow, a bruiſe, a wound, and the rankling of it in every veine, from head to foot, to all eternity?</p>
               <p>Severall things lead me to thinke that the great day of Chriſts judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be very dreadfull to all the wicked: One, becauſe man ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare then not as a ſhadow, but as a ſubſtance, as an everlaſting ſubſtance, to beare the height of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Secondly, becauſe his ſinnes alſo ſhall not then appeare as a ſhadow. Alas, 'tis but the ſhadow of ſinne, that revives and appeareth in conſcience now; and yet when this reſurrection is, of the ſhadow of ſinne, man dies, <hi>is feare round about;</hi> but then ſinne in its ſubſtance, the heart of ſinne, yea ſinne with all its demenſions, longitude, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, height, depth, bredth, every
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54212:21"/>ſecret which now no eye ſees; the bookes ſhall be then opened, and every idle word, and idle thought ſhall be ſet in order, and all the dead ſtretched out and layd naked before him with whom we have to doe; yea and ſet in order before the ſoule it ſelfe, and conſcience made to ſay, all this is true: When there ſhall be ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, of all the dead, ſinnes dead and gone out of memory for many ſcores of yeeres, all together made to revive in conſcience at once, with all their circumſtances of time, place, and the like, in their full ſtrength; and Chriſt by in all his glory, and all the Saints and holy Angels, ſeeing all as plainly as the man himſelfe; theſe things make me think 'twill be then a very dreadull day to all ungodly wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was poſſeſt with this thing better by far then I am, and laboured to poſſeſſe his hearers, with it, as now I do you. <hi>Knowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the terror of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.11. What is this terror? why the point I am upon; read the Verſe foregoing; <hi>For we muſt all appear before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54212:22"/>everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad:</hi> Knowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the terror of the Lord, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men. Chriſt being riſen, all ſhall riſe; all men, and all their actions, good and bad; and theſe ſhall be proclaimed all over the world at once, all over two worlds at once met together; this to the wicked will be terrible indeed, the very glimpſes of this are terrible: therefore ſure the thing it ſelfe farre more. When <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned with <hi>Faelix</hi> about judgement to come. <hi>Faelix</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. When <hi>Herod</hi> did but thinke that <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> was riſen again whom he had murthered, how it affrighted him. <hi>Herod</hi> feared <hi>Iohn</hi> when alive, but much more after he aroſe and lived again, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.15, 16. one from the dead is terrible. Perſons in their reſurrection are other perſons for majeſty and terrour: ſo ſinnes in their reſurrection, are other ſinnes for bigneſſe, dread, and horror; all theſe meeting will make horripilation in perfection, every haire of thy head ſtare, every eye-ſtring ſtretch, and every heart-ſtring twiſt together, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54212:22"/>teare; and yet no eye ſhall pity thee, of all that innumerable company of juſt men made perfect that then ſhall appeare and ſit upon thee.</p>
               <p>Let no wile cauſe you to evade the weight of things. <hi>And when they heard of the reſurrection of the dead, ſome moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and others ſaid, we will heate thee again of this matter, Acts</hi> 17.32.

Chriſt being riſen, and come before his father ſpotleſſe, as having done all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted well, his father is forced to juſtifie him, and ſo all the elect in him; hence when any layeth charge and challenge to us, whether Satan, ſinne, or conſcience; this obligation is upon God by Chriſts reſurrection, to ſtand up, acquit, and juſtifie us, who is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all that can condemn us, yea greater then our own conſcience in his juſtification of us, as he is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then our owne concience in his condemnation of us; and this is that which over beareth and over-ruleth all, which would overbeare our ſpirit, and our peace. This is the life of that Scripture alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.7. <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your ſinnes.</hi> Which Scripture ſheweth where ſinners ſhould take hold to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in Chriſt, as riſen and juſtified in our perſon; faith ſhould particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly make application of this, that I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54212:24"/>am juſtified in him, and ſo all my ſinnes done away in his acquittance and juſtification. Chriſt being riſen and juſtified, I am juſtified in him; this is the proper motion and exerciſe of faith in this point; <hi>I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer lives. Jeb</hi> takes particular hold of the reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>(i)</hi> hold in his own behalfe, that he ſhould live alſo by him. And this opens that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult place of Scripture, Rom. 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. (i.)</hi> that Chriſt is riſen, and acquitted, as perſonating thee. The words doe not mean a hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall faith, the believing of ſuch a hiſtory: but an applicatory faith, as I mentioned; and he that doth thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is indeed ſaved and delivered from the bond and condemnation of his ſinnes. This will be better ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and evidenced, by referring it to proper examples. <hi>Abraham</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in God <hi>that quickned the dead,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: which points firſt at <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and in him to Chriſt. Now what was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in God, concerning
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54212:24"/>
                  <hi>Iſaac?</hi> meerly, that God would raiſe him, and put life againe into him? &amp;c No; his faith was, that God would quicken him from the dead, and give him again into his boſome to be his heire, and his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his laughter, joy, glory, and crown of his family: and this ſheweth how he believed in Chriſt whom <hi>Iſaac</hi> typiſied; that God would quicken him from the dead for him; that he would raiſe Chriſt, and give him into his boſome, to be his heire, his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his laughter and joy; that God would take Chriſt from the grave, and acquit him and <hi>Abraham</hi> in him; or elſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> would have been impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for righteouſneſſe. <hi>He againſt hope believed in hope:</hi> ſo ſhould we, againſt all that ſence, Satan can ſay about our ſinnes, ſtill believe in God that quickneth the dead; that God hath raiſed and acquitted Chriſt, and therefore me, being perſonated in him. And this was <hi>Iohs</hi> faith concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſts reſurrection, he was not meerly hiſtoricall in this point, but evangelicall and applicatory, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth by his words, <hi>I know that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54212:25"/>my Redeemer lives,</hi> that God quickneth my <hi>Iſaac</hi> from the dead, <hi>whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we are delivered from the guilt of ſinne, by this that Chriſt is riſen, ſo from the power of ſinne; <note place="margin">Rom. 8.11</note> therefore is this point I am upon, <hi>Canaan</hi> milke and honey, to all the people of God. <hi>He that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken our mortall bodies, by his Spirit which dwels in us: therefore are we debtors not to the fleſh, to fulſill the luſts thereof,</hi> but to this quickning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which the deeds of the body are mortified. The riſing of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, is in the little world as the riſing of the naturall Sunne in the great world; that which makes all riſe, open, and revive with it, infuſeth vigor, warmth, ſpirit, which makes all the creation renew, and give forth freſh glory and verue ſtill. And this is the meaning and opening of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Malachy,</hi> who uſeth this very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor; <hi>To you which feare my name ſhall the Sunne of righteouſneſſe ariſe, with healing in his wings, and ye ſhall goe forth and grow up as calves of the ſtall.</hi> That Chriſt is riſen, ſhall be to all you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54212:25"/>that feare Gods name, to your diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, infirme, ungrowing ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the riſing of the Sunne upon a debile body; that which ſhall ſend forth a power, ſpirit and vigor into your ſoules, which ſhall heale all your diſeaſes, and make you full of ſpirit, and ſpringing abundantly. Nature is excited by the riſing of the Sunne, and ſtrengthened to bud, bloſſome, and beare. <hi>Paul</hi> was well aware of the great benefit of this point I am now upon, as appeareth by his high expreſſion of this matter. <hi>And what is the excellent greatneſſe of his power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him on his right hand.</hi> Epheſ. 1.19, 20. You which believe have advantage by the reſurrection of Chriſt, to pray for and expect ſuch a power as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great to work in your ſoules for the ſubduing of your ſinnes, and quickning of you to all good, as wrought in Chriſt when raiſed, (and then ſurely the power of God wrought in height in Chriſt, if ever) ſo farre forth as finite States are capable of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54212:26"/>operation of ſuch an infinite power and vertue; which is a foundation of ſingular conſolation, in order to all our preſent weakneſſe, deadneſſe, and unheavenlineſſe; and all this vertue promiſed to be given to ſuch as feare him. Such a Sun-ſhine upon thee, O poore Chriſtian, Chriſt being riſen, as thou art not aware of; what glory and vertue, healing and growth it will raiſe thee to! Such a Sunne is riſen upon thee, which will make thee riſe and ſhine every day more and more, unto the perfect day, which will make thee perfect to every good work, to doe his will. <hi>Now the God of peace which brought again from the dead our Lord Ieſus, make you perfect in every good work to doe his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I may adde yet one thing more, as conſolatory. Chriſt being riſen, the people of God are delivered not onely from ſinne, but alſo from the rigor of duty and obedience. Chriſt being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, that body which he had here is changed, and in that ſenſe put away, and Chriſt married to another, to a gloriſied body; and the laying down
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54212:26"/>of this tabernacle, and betaking by his reſurrection to a more ſpirituall ſtate, going from a naturall to a ſpirituall body by his reſurrection, is a myſtery; it ſpeaks the Law dead which obliged the naturall body of Chriſt, and ſo his naturall ſoule, as one truely man as we are, to doe all the will of God: this obligation in his naturall body he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and then laid it down, and by his reſurrection takes up another ſtate, a Spirituall body; laid down his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body, marries himſelfe againe unto another, to wit, a Spirituall body: that body upon which the Law tooke hold being gone, the Law is gone to, <hi>(i.)</hi> one being changed, the other is changed. <note place="margin">Rom. 7.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye are become dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him who is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, we might ſerve him in newneſſe of ſpirit. The meaning of which words is, that we are apt to account that the Law in the ſtrictneſſe of it, took hold of Chriſt whilſt here in the body, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54212:27"/>was exactly anſwered, and together with that body diſſolved, and not any more to take hold of any body per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated in that, but we as he are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to another, a more Spirituall, Evangelicall and raiſed condition of duty &amp; conſolation. Chriſt being riſen, and in his naturall body anſwered and abrogated the rigor of the Law in our perſon, is now our ſtanding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with the Lord at his right hand, and ſo we are to look unto him for perfection, in order to all that which the Law commands, and ſay to all the demands of the Law, that we are dead to them through the body of Chriſt, and married to another. To this a greeth <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctiſied, through the offering up of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> Out of love to Chriſt, who did thus out of love to us, ſow his naturall body, and raiſed it a ſpirituall (in all ſimplicity, as farre forth as we can) we ſhould tread in his very ſteps of that Law which he exactly anſwered, and if poſſible attaine his reſurrection, walke in Gods will, as Chriſt did on earth, and as Chriſt doth now in Heaven;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54212:27"/>this is called in Scripture <hi>dying unto ſinne, and living unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> and being perfect as our heavenly father. The Law is Goſpell, thus Goſpelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and the Goſpell is Law, thus le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallized.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Finally, Chriſt being riſen, he is improving his raiſed ſtate, not onely in order to your good in this world, but to your glory in the world to come. Chriſt being riſen, he is gone to prepare a place for you, and to make it ſit for your raiſed condition, when you ſhall come unto it. <hi>And if I goe and prepare a place for you, I will come againe and receive you to my ſelfe, that where I am ye may be; becauſe I live ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> That Chriſt is riſen, and lives again, you ought from this to deduct to your ſelves the higheſt conſolation; that you ſhall riſe and live, as now he doth. <hi>Iob</hi> doth in this ſort, and at this height comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>I know that my Redeemer lives, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth;</hi> and obſerve what he dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth from hence, <hi>and though after my skinne Worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54212:28"/>from my ſelfe.</hi> If a man dies, ſhall he live again? yes; how doth this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare? why Chriſt that was dead is riſen, and lives in glory, and all his glorious workes live with him; and where he lives, you and your workes ſhall live alſo; there ſhall be a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, aſcention, and glorification of all: which ſhould make one willing and waiting to die, and change lives, this for that; thus did <hi>Iob</hi> upon this ground.

How active Chriſt was after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to poſt away as it were, about this great worke, to take poſſeſſion of Heaven for us, and to prepare a life and livelihood like his own, is very obſervable; read <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.11, 12, 13,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54212:28"/>14, 15. the ſtory is concerning <hi>Mary,</hi> who after Chriſts death ſought him mourning, with this deſigne to take him away, as appeareth by her words at the fifteenth verſe, <hi>Sir, if thou have borne him from hence, tell me where thou haſt laid him, and I will take him away.</hi> Upon this Chriſt diſcovers himſelfe to her in the next verſe, and withall ſaith unto her, <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my father, but goe to my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my father, and your father, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis probable, for as much as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Mary</hi> as ſoon as he had made known himſelfe to her, <hi>touch me not,</hi> that <hi>Mary</hi> was on upon her deſigne to take him away, to draw him away with her to ſome better place then where ſhe found him, and to purſue her deſigne upon the living, which ſhe meant upon the dead; which tender love, how vigorouſly did Chriſt withſtand, that he might without all delay improve his reſurrection, to our higheſt good; to take poſſeſſion of God, and all that glory in which now he lives? <hi>Touch me not,</hi> that thou ſtay me not in the leaſt from ſeiſing upon thine and thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns

               <p>And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>That as in Adam we all die, ſo in Chriſt we ſhall all be made alive;</hi> and ſo conſequently that Chriſt is ſent to make all alive, and to turne every one to God: the Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth himſelfe, writing to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> ſhewing that his meaning is not, that the efficacy of each, to wit, the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> is in the ſame manner neceſſarily extenſive; but ſaith, that the efficacy of the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is neceſſarily extenſive; but the efficacy of the other extenſive onely of free grace through faith, to them to whom Chriſt ſhall give this.

               </p>
               <p>Finally, all may be reſumed and rendered for the opening of this clauſe, in other words to the ſame effect. —<hi>To turn every one of you, (i.)</hi> who are by the purpoſe of God to be turned: and ſo the expreſſion not ſtricty noting
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54212:36"/>the univerſality of perſons to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the ſtrict propriety of Chriſt in this worke of turning ſoules to God. Chriſt is to turne every one that is to be turned; this Chriſt which you ſo deſpiſe, and ſo little eſteeme; not a ſoule amongſt you can be turned and ſaved from your ſinne, but by him. Thus doe many of the learned read and render theſe words: and thus doth Chriſt himſelfe open that place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>And all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord, &amp;c. (i.)</hi> all which are taught, are taught by him, and can by none elſe come to learne unto life. Thus doth Chriſt explaine this place of the Prophet, as appeares by his words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44, 45. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day, as it is written in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and they ſhall be all taught of God: (i.)</hi> all that are taught are taught of God, and none elſe can learn this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of comming to Chriſt, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on him, but ſuch as are taught of God.</p>
               <p>So that this clauſe of my Text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus opened, the poynt you ſee to

                  <hi>That it is Chriſts proper work to turn ſinners from their ſinnes:</hi> a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe devolved by joynt conſent upon him, the Father and the holy Spirit working in and by him, and no otherwaies, to this great end, the converſion and ſalvation of man. The Scriptures which concurre to this truth, are many, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me, to preach good tidings unto the meeke; he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaime liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, &amp;c.</hi> This place confirmes the point, and alſo what I have before ſaid, that Chriſt is not ſent to turne all, but a generation of ſinners which are <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the meeke and broken in heart,</hi> (i.) ſuch as are ſelf condemned, and lie under the bleeding ſence of their own wretched condition; prickt at heart with the ſting of ſinne, which may be, and yet in no actuall ſtate of grace; to be Phyſician to theſe ſick, wounded, bleeding, and dying ones, is Chriſts proper place and employment. To this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54212:37"/>may be added, Acts 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſinner.</hi> The like Scripture is, 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chiefe.</hi> 'Tis Chriſts proper worke you ſee, and his alone, to turn and ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The type of this read <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.10. <hi>When Rehecca alſo concerved by one, even by our father Iſaac.</hi> But one in the bed, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the holy ſeed is begotten: Chriſt caſts that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeed into her wombe, by which the generation of the new creature is made, and none but he; he begets, brings forth, and breeds up; hence called, <hi>the authour and finiſher of our faith:</hi> and faith is called converſion, becauſe indeed it is the formality of it <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, except you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and become as a little child, yee ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And then in the following words ſaith, <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me, Matth.</hi> 18.6.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54212:38"/>What he cals converſion before, Here he cals faith, becauſe faith indeed is converſion; the ſoule crediting Chriſt in what the word ſaith of him, and ſo reſigning it ſelfe wholly to him, to be ruled by him, and by his will, and not any longer by his own luſts and ſinnes; and this is the turning of the ſoule from ſinne, which my Text here ſpeaks of. There are ſeverall things in faith, to underſtand, to credit, to ſubmit, and ſimply to ſubmit; to ſubmit as a childe, who doth not contend or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but ſaith in his heart, my father bids be doe thus, and this is enough; and all theſe Chriſt workes in the ſoule, and none elſe. Chriſt enlightens the ſoule, ſhines into the heart, and makes it ſee what had never been told ef. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.15. Chriſt meekens and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the ſoule, pricks the heart, lets out all thoſe corrupt things which ſwel and puſſe up the ſpirit againſt God: Chriſt takes off headineſſe, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and bows the heart to hearken &amp; conſider; and then workes to wil, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades <hi>Iaphet,</hi> O that I had a dwelling in the tents of <hi>Shem,</hi> that I could believe on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Who is he Lord, that I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54212:38"/>might believe on him?</hi> and then workes to doe, to truſt in him to deny all and follow him: and now is the ſoule tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from its ſinnes.</p>
               <p>But this is but in part. This ſtate of ſoule is called a heart after Gods own: one in this world as Chriſt; which is not ſtrictly to be taken, as if any whilſt in this world were ſo pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed in affection and action, as Chriſt, ſo ſeparated from ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his nature and life in this world, as he was; but it meaneth what a converted man is in his intention, in his endeavour, and in Gods acceptation. The heart truely turned to God, aimes and intends a courſe and motion in this world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like Chriſt, hath reſpect to all Chriſts commandements, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Great and little, as the Phariſees and hypocrites were wont to make; loves all, and would with all his heart, all his waies were ſo direct as to keepe all Gods ſtatutes; to this height is his aime, his deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; for this he prayes, ſighes, groans; and in this heavenly induſtry conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth, runnes, and is not weary, that if by any meanes he might attaine the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54212:39"/>reſurrection from the dead; and this in Gods acceptation, is a heart as Gods own, and holy as he is holy, and turned and ſeparated from ſinne as he.</p>
               <p>If this be properly Chriſts work to turne you from your ſinne, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> know upon whoſe ſhoulders God hath placed your hardeſt work, ye that are the people of God, and expect that he will goe thorough with it. The hardeſt worke of a Chriſtian is to turn from his ſinne, and beares more upon him then any thing: 'tis true that many things goe ill, but this goeth moſt to my heart; that ſinne cleaves ſo faſt unto me, ſaith a good ſoule. Why Chriſt will doe that wherein thy difficulty lies, he will ſubdue thine iniquities, and eaſt thy ſinne into the depth of the Sea, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.19. he will break every bond, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move every weight which preſſeth down; greater is he that is in you, then the greateſt corruption that is in you; the grace of Chriſt is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to withſtand what intices, and to deſtroy what intices; for this cauſe is Chriſt manifeſted to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, yea to deſtroy the works of the Divell. Chriſt doth turn us from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54212:39"/>to deſtroy it. The covenant is, that Chriſt ſhall ſet in our heart as a reſiner, and purifier of Silver, and ſhall purifie thee as they doe thoſe mettles, that thou mayſt offer an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in righteouſneſſe, a pleaſant offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and this being the covenant, every thing ſhall conduce to this fruit, the turning thy heart from thy ſinne, <hi>(i.)</hi> the purging and refining of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, corrections. <hi>I will turn mine hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy droſſe,</hi> ſaith the Lord; therefore ſurely this hard worke will be down; <hi>Goliah</hi> will be ſlaine, and a little thing ſhall doe it. If Chriſt be long ere he doe a neceſſary work, it is probable that he will doe it very remarkably, with ſome pibble of the brook. with ſome Jaw-bone thrown by, will he ſmite to death at once heaps upon heaps, all that hath ſmote to death the peace and comfort of thy ſoule ſo long; not by might, or by ſtrength, doth Chriſt doe this, that thine eye may be much ſixed upon: but by a ſtill blow within, by his Spirit, ſhall be the death of that which hath been the death of thy life hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. If Chriſt worke all our workes in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54212:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>us, ſurely this work which is all, the turning of the heart from ſinne, he will not leave undone, he will purely purge thy ſoule, renew a right ſpirit within thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>If this be the work of Chriſt, to turn ſinner from their ſinnes, then when Chriſt is about this work doe not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: he ſtands at the doore and knocks; yea more calls, <hi>To you O men I call; whoſo is ſimple, let him turn in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> yea points, <hi>this is the way, walk in it:</hi> nay, and blocks up all other waies; ſometimes croſſes, and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes the man in other courſes, hedges him up, that he cannot finde his way; convinces, ſalts the ſoule with fire, makes the mans own heart condemne him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all this ſpeakes Chriſt about his worke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to turn thee from thy ſinne: and indeed if thou ſinde theſe things, Chriſt is at his worke hard, O take heed of oppoſing and contradicting his glorious worke.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If this be the work of Chriſt, to turn ſinners from their ſinnes, let not Chriſt want worke; preſent your conditions unto him, and deſire him to undertake them. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that which endures to eve laſting life, which the ſonne of man ſhall give unto you; for him hath the Father ſealed,</hi> Joh. 6.22. That this is

And hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt came to ſave ſinners,</hi> the chiefe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Let this point be of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto you; you that have ſlaine Chriſt, and your own ſoules, yet think what Chriſt is made unto you, he is made to make you, to new make you who have marred your ſelves, and waites thus to be gracious &amp; his meat and drinke is to be pulling ſuch brands out of the fire, and to quench them before they be quite burnt. Chriſt is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf, &amp; as willing. You have done thus &amp; thus ſaith God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet be not deſperate; I <hi>Sam.</hi> 12 20. ſo ſay I to you, great ſinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Finally, when I ſay this is the proper worke of Chriſt to turn people from their ſinnes, it is not to be underſtood as if we ſhould not be inſtrumentall in his hand: the effecting of this worke
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54212:41"/>is indeed upon one, but the means in and by which he doth this, beares up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many ſhoulders, Magiſtrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, yea every one that is turned, is by the law of that very condition, as converted, to labour to convert o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and as advantages are more, ſo to be more inſtrumentall this way: generall calling, and particular calling, both ſometimes engage this way. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in government have this ſcope to beare up God, and to beat down that and be a terror to that which would deface him. God hath a double power, by which he doth his great workes in this world, one ſecret and inviſible, in which he alone is; of which ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.4. <hi>And God ſaw the Light that it was good, and God divided between the light, and between the darkneſſe.</hi> Since this act of ſeparation, light will not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with darkneſſe; being parted, they conſtantly keepe apart, oppoſe, and continually conflict and expell each other, and this is by a ſecret power of God inviſible; and this is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized by the Apoſtle, and applied to ſinne and grace, 2 Cor. 6.14. <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe?
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54212:42"/>and what communion hath light with darkneſſe?</hi> That the heart is made of darkneſſe light, that theſe two are ſeparated, and continually keepe ſo; that grace and corruption continually conflict, and are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contradictory; this is by a ſecret power of God inviſible. But then God hath a viſible power, theſe are all his Ordinances, Magiſtracy, Miniſtery; theſe are <hi>Jakin</hi> and <hi>Boas,</hi> the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall pillars of all grace and good in this world; the pipes by which, and in which he conveyeth vigour and force againſt ſinne, and unto good.</p>
               <p>How perſons in authority may be ſubſervient to this great deſigne, to turne men from their ſinnes, is ſet forth in two places, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be obeyed? and ſhall not thy younger brother be ſubject to thee,</hi> and acknowledge thy birth-right, and be guided and ruled by thee? thus <hi>Ainſworth</hi> comments upon this place. Holineſſe in men of place makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and terrour upon all unholineſſe; cleare as the Sunne, and then terrible as an Army with Banners: be learned, yea, be holy, ye that ſway the Scepter:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54212:42"/>or elſe ye will not be inſtrumentall in the hand of Chriſt, to turn men from ſinne, but to draw them to it. The ſecond Scripture is in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. at the third and fourth verſes; you have <hi>Iehoſaphats</hi> holineſſe, and anſwerably Gods owning of him. <hi>And the Lord was with Iehoſaphat, becauſe he walked in the firſt waies of his father David and ſought not unto Balaant, but ſought the Lord God of his father, and walked in his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: therefore the Lord eſtabliſhed the Kingdome in his hand, and all Judah brought to Jehoſaphat preſents, and he had riches and honour in abundance, and his heart was liſted up in the waies of the Lord.

And the feare of the Lord fell upon all the Kingdomes of the Land that were round thout Iudah, ſo that they made no warre

               <p>Two things you ſee concern men in place, to ſubſerve Chriſt in this great worke of turning ſinners from their ſinnes; to be holy themſelves, and to plant the means of holineſſe; neglect theſe, and reglect all, to bring peace and plenty into this poore Land. Wherefore ſtirre up your ſelves unto theſe things, and in this worke, tender not one place but all; <hi>England. Wales, Ireland.</hi> Gentiles, yea and the Jewes: think, if it be poſſible. how you may be inſtrumentall for the good of that forlorne people: and now you are removing guilt from the Land, that you would doe it throughly, and leave
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54212:43"/>if poſſible none upon us, reſpecting Jew or Gentile. The Scriptures by which I would urge to this, are two; and of two ſorts: one of promiſe, the other of ſevere threat. That of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32:20. <hi>Bleſſed are ye that ſow beſide all waters, that ſend forth thither the ſect of the Oxe, and the Aſſe.</hi> 'Tis a bleſſed worke to be ſowing beſide all waters, to be propagating the Goſpell every where, to be breaking up all grounds that lie fallow, and ſilling the world with weeds and tares; but to ſend forth thither the Ox and the Aſſe, that is painfull inſtruments to that poore people the Jews, to call upon that <hi>Shulamite returne,</hi> is peculiarly and eminently bleſſed: and the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this expreſſion, <hi>Returne O Shulamite, return, returne,</hi> which Maſter <hi>Brightm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54212:44"/>how gladly would I have <hi>England</hi> be the foremoſt in this bleſſed worke, to give the firſt call to the Shulamite, who were the firſt I am afraid, that gave ſharpe repulſe and expulſe unto them. The other Scripture I would urge you with, is threatning to all that ſhall deale hardly with that people. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, after the glory hath he ſent me to the Nations which ſpoyled you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye: for behold, I will ſhake mine hand upon them, and they ſhall be a ſpoyle to their ſervants, and ye ſhall know that the Lord of hoaſts hath ſent me. After the glory hath he ſent me to the Nations that ſpoyled you, (i.)</hi> after God hath accompliſhed the reſtitution of this people, who ſhall be the viſible glory of all Nations; then will God viſit all thoſe Nations who have been injurious to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and by this people injured, be revenged upon them, like as <hi>Mordecai</hi> and his brethren upon <hi>Haman</hi> and his followers; <hi>for this remnant of Iacob ſhall be among the Gentiles in the midſt of many people, as a Lyon among the beaſts of the Forreſt, as a young Lyon in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54212:44"/>midſt of the flocks of ſheep or goats; the originall is either, who if he goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, both treads it down, and teares it in pieces, and none can deliver. Mica.</hi> 5.8. To this agrees <hi>Mica.</hi> 4.13: <hi>Ariſe and threſh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make thy horne iron, and I will make thy hoofes braſſe, and thou ſhalt beat in pieces many people, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Conſider you who are in places of power, how you are called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>whole ſtay of bread, and the whole ſtay of water.</hi> Iſa. 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>and healers, and binders up, Iſa.</hi> 3.7. and your ſalve, by which to heale and bind up, I have told you, namely to live holy, and to plant the meanes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe among all people, Gentile and Jew; and ſhort of this, ſurely you wil not be healers and binders up, and ſo have your name for naught. If you ſay, this is troubleſome and coſtly, I wil anſwer, as the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.18 <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, that created the Heavens, God himſelfe that formed the Earth, and made it: he eſtabliſhed it, he created it not in vaine, not to be empty,</hi> ſaith the originall; which rendring beſt anſwers the clauſe that followeth, <hi>he formed it to be inhabited, I am the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> The earth was not made to be empty, ſaith the Prophet; if no part of the earth was made to be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and uſeleſſe, then ſurely not the fat and fertile parts of the earth: you Londoners are watered with wealth, like <hi>Eden,</hi> the garden of God; you are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54212:45"/>the fat and fertile part of the Lands and therefore ſurely you are not made to be empty; fruitfull exhalations by the love of Chriſt, ſhould be made and aſcend from your full purſes, and fall in dewes and ſilver-drops all the Land over, where poore barren places are, and people ſtarved by thouſands, in body and ſoule. Then for paines and labour, I would ſay this to you, 'tis eaſier to beare the burthen of duty upon our bodies, then to heare the burden of guilt for the neglect of duty, upon our ſoules. If the City and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome lie tumbling ſtill in blindneſſe and wickedneſſe, and no means uſed to ſerve Chriſts providence, to turn theſe poore creatures from their ſins, where will all the ſinnes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome lie) at whoſe doore, and how heavy? The cry and ſcrich of one loſt ſoule ſtarted up in thy conſcience, will more tug and waſte thy ſpirits, then all other pains and travels we now exhort unto. A holy man bewailes much our condition, that we know not the reaſon of the originall names of many things, though we know our father <hi>Adam</hi> did name all things ſignificantly: as why
